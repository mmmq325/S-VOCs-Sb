# S-VOCs-Sb
Adsorption of S-VOCs on Li and Mg decorated antimonene
The following structure models (.vasp or POSCAR format) were used.
Initial structures
p-Sb directory: pristine antimonene in 4x4x1 supercell
Li-Sb directory: single Li atom decorated antimonene in 4x4x1 supercell
Mg-Sb directory: single Mg atom decorated antimonene in 4x4x1 supercell
iso-VOCs directory: isolated VOCs.

with VOCs
p-Sb-VOCs: initial adsorption configurations (h1, h2, ....) of VOCs on p-Sb
Li-Sb-VOCs: initial adsorption configurations (h1, h2, ....) of VOCs on Li-Sb
Mg-Sb-VOCs: initial adsorption configurations (h1, h2, ....) of VOCs on Mg-Sb
